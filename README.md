# Sailing simulation in HTML canvas

The goal of this project is for it to eventually become an in-browser minigame allowing a user to experiment with the basics of sailing. 
In the process of making it I will hopefully also learn a bit more about how sailing works myself, as well as some more about web development.

It is very much a work in progress.

## Implemented Features(Improvements still to be made)
- keyboard controls for tiller and sail. The A and D keys steer port and starboard, I(n) and O(ut) keys let sail in and out according to wind
- boat and environment are displayed
- wind direction/speed indicated
- boat speed and course displayed
- somewhat realistic effects of water and wind on the boat based on physics
- somewhat realistic steering with the tiller
- sail increases drag when too close to wind and flags to indicate this
- main sheet shown to make boat state clearer
- goals appear which award points when user navigates to them (Snake but with a boat)

## Intended Features
- apparent wind indicator
- objects draw themselves
- mobile compatibility
- visual improvements to boat and water
- infinite sailing mode (view moves rather than boat)
- shared-keyboard multiplayer
- algorithmically controlled boats
- randomly generated coastline for infinite sailing mode
