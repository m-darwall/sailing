# Sailing simulation in HTML canvas

The goal of this project is for it to eventually become an in-browser minigame allowing a user to experiment with the basics of sailing. 
In the process of making it I will hopefully also learn a bit more about how sailing works myself, as well as some more about web development.

It is very much a work in progress.

## Implemented Features
- boat with keyboard controls for tiller and sail
- boat and environment are displayed
- wind direction/speed indicated
- boat stats displayed

## Intended Features
- somewhat realistic effects of water and wind on the boat based on physics(currently working on this)
- somewhat realistic steering with the tiller
- control sail with i(n) and o(ut) keys rather than w(right) and s(left)
- sail moves out in direction suggested by wind
- sail fills when wind is acting on it
- goals appear which award points when user navigates to them (Snake but with a boat)
- mobile compatibility
- visual improvements to boat and water
- infinite sailing mode (view moves rather than boat)
- shared-keyboard multiplayer
- algorithmically controlled boats
- randomly generated coastline for infinite sailing mode
