# Sailing simulation in HTML canvas

The goal of this project is for it to eventually become an in-browser mini-game demonstrating the basics of sailing. 
In the process I will hopefully also learn a bit more about how sailing works myself, as well as some more about the 
workings of JavaScript.

Currently it is very much a work in progress.
